When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  This exetremely usefull when you need to work on your project from different workstations or when you collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git autmatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	At this point I'm not sure about this concept. But I guess it related to posible conflicts between changes made to repository by you or other collaborators.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork - it's a copy of another repository made within GitHub. Clone - local copy of repository(may be only local without GitHub). Branch - alternative version of code existing within repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It allows you to see what changes are already stored on remote side.
