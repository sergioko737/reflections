When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  This exetremely usefull when you need to work on your project from different workstations or when you collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git autmatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	At this point I'm not sure about this concept. But I guess it related to posible conflicts between changes made to repository by you or other collaborators.
